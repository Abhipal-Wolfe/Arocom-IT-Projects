# Arocom-IT-Projects
A total of 4 projects were given.

1. A multiclass classification problem to predict the price of a mobile phone based on previously collected data. A perfectly balanced dataset was given containing three classes for the target variable(i.e. price range). A stacking ensemble model was used to achieve a 99.5% accuracy on test data. Finally, a web app was developed to take in details about a new mobile phone and display which price-range it belonged to. 

2. Sentiment Analysis on Amazon food reviews. An unbalanced dataset containing half a million text reviews with scores from 1-5 for each review was provided. The task was to predict whether an incoming review was positive/negative and also a score for the said review. After iterating through various dataset balancing methods, ensemble models as well as deep learning models, a sentiment prediction model with a 92% accuracy on test data was developed and a score prediction model with a 72% accuracy was developed. Finally, a web app to take in a new review and display its sentiment and score was developed.

3. A binary classification problem to predict wether a shipped item reached its destination on time or not. The final model was a stacking ensemble model that achieved a weigthed F1 score of 0.68 on the test set, a cross validation training accuracy of 0.6835 and a testing accuracy of 0.6831. Finally a web app to take in a new set of values for the features and display wether the item reached on time or not was developed and deployed. 

4. A binary classification problem to predict wether an individual was in risk of suffering a stroke or not. The dataset provided was highly imbalanced so the SMOTE dataset balancing technique was used alongwith a stacking ensemble model to achieve an F1 score of 0.92 with a testing accuracy of 0.9422
